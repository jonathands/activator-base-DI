## Act

###### This  POC implements an "activator"  dependency injector:

an activator is an anonymous class that delays dependency initialization to avoid running unecessary initialization and creating unecessary object in memory, while enabling a more hands off approach to dependency injection.

This is just a POC to test how the idea would work
